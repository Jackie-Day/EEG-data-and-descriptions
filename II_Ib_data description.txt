Data details:
II_Ib is a 2-class EEG data set, which in total contains 200 EEG trials with 8065 samples for each trial. Each row is an EEG trial.
The first column codes the class of the trial (1/2). The remaining columns contain samples of the 7 EEG channels. 
This starts with 1152 samples from channel 1 and ends with 1152 samples from channel 7. 
Class 1 contains 100 trials * 8065 samples and Class 2 contains 100 trials * 8065 samples.
