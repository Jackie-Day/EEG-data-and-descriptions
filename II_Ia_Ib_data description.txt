
II_Ia_Ib: 
This data set is a mixed one with II_Ia (2-class 268 trials*5377 samples) and II_Ib (2-class 200 trials*8065 samples). 
II_Ia is recorded from a healthy subject while II_Ib is recorded from an artificially respirated ALS patient.

In this data set, II_Ib is kept the class labels and the remaining 8064 data points are down-sampled into 5376. Finally, II_Ib is replaced by 200 trials*5377 smaples.

II_Ia_Ib is a 4-class EEG data set obtained by mixing II_Ia and down-sampled II_Ib, which contains 468 EEG trials with 5377 samples for each trial. Each row is an EEG trial.
The first column codes the class of the trial (1/2/3/4). The remaining columns contain recording EEG data. Class 1 contains 135 trials*5377 samples;
Class 2 contains 133 trials*5377 samples; Class 3 contains 100 trials* 5377 samples, and Class 4 contains 100 trials*5377 samples.
