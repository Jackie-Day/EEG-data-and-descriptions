Each channel records 896 samples. 


Data details:
II_Ia is a 2-class EEG data set, which in total contains 268 EEG trials with 5377 samples for each trial. Each row is an EEG trial.
The first column codes the class of the trial (1/2). The remaining columns contain samples of the 6 EEG channels. 
This starts with 896 samples from channel 1 and ends with 896 samples from channel 6. 
Class 1 contains 135 trials * 5377 samples and Class 2 contains 133 trials * 5377 samples.
