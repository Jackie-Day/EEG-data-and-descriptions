Fig2 data set:

This EEG data set will help you replicate Fig.2. 
This data are recorded from a healthy subject. He was asked to move a cursor up or down on the screen. During the period, his EEG are recorded.
The data set contains 8 EEG trials*5376 samples. Each row is an EEG trial. The first four trials belong to Class 1 (cursor up) and the last four trials belong to Class 2 (cursor down).
They are not z-normalized to compute Frechet distance, Dynamic time warping, Hausdorff distance and Euclidean disntance. All the distances are computed with Matlab 2014b.
